# My Learning Journey

A combination of being a technical leader, SME with Cisco Umbrella, and desire to code and automate my process lead to a new position at Cisco. I'm now part of our Strategy and Planning team helping work towards standardization of Customer Success delivery across our portfolio of Cloud Security software. Recently, I've been given the opportunity to develop an in-house tool for producing an automatically generated health and configuration report for Cisco Customer Success. This will likely give me roughly 6 months of full time development experience producing this internal tool. The tool should augment renewal rates for hundreds of millions in renewals revenue at Cisco.
